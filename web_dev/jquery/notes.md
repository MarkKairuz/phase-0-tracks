I plan to bing multiple jQuery site resources. I plan on using w3shools.com to help in this process, since it has helped me a whole lot during phase 0. I plan to stop and test what I just learned often. I may take breaks every 20 minutes or when I am stumped or feel like I need a break. I feel that breaks are important. I plan to take as much of what I have learned and try to make something amazing with it. I plan to use the click activation to create something. Maybe make colors change and images move around. I will start searching online for a major site first to get my feet wet and then check out stackoverflow and see what people talk about. I feel this is a good way to learn what's available out there.

There were a lot of interesting jQuery sites, but the best one I found was w3schools.com. It seems like it was more effective for me to learn when I get to play around with the code. It was also handy getting up once in a while to stretch or snack on something. It was actually fun learning some things about jQuery.
