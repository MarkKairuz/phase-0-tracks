# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is where software is updated through different revisions and version control manages the changes. This is useful to help the user keep track of changes and recall previous revisions.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the master directory. A branch helps the user make changes without affecting the master directory until it is copied onto the master.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Commit is pretty much the save point of the directory. A good commit message shows changes in the directory to help refer back to the change.

* What is a merge conflict?
Merge conflict happens when there are changes that conflicts with the directory where the branch is being merged to. This could be changes on the same line with both directories, or when a file is deleted in one but updated in another.
